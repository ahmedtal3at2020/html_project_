        What does statistics bring to Big Data and where are the opportunities?</p></h1>
    <ol>
        <li> Big Data will often not be served well by “off the shelf” methods or black box computational tools that work in low-dimensional and less complicated settings, and therefore require tailored statistical methods.  </li>
        <li> Statisticians are skillful at assessing and correcting for bias; measuring uncertainty; designing studies and sampling strategies; assessing the quality of data; enumerating limitations of studies; dealing with issues such as missing data and other sources of non-sampling error; developing models for the analysis of complex data structures; creating methods for causal inference and comparative effectiveness; eliminating redundant and uninformative variables; combining information from multiple sources; and determining effective data visualization techniques.  </li>

    <h1>
    <p>Why is it important for statistics to be one of the key disciplines for Big Data? </p></h1>
    <ol>
<li>Statistics is fundamental to ensuring meaningful, accurate information is extracted from Big Data. The following issues are crucial and are only 
    
    exacerbated by Big Data:<ul>

        <li>Data quality and missing data </li>
        <li>Observational nature of data, so that causal questions such as the comparison of interventions may be subject to confounding.</li>
        <li>Quantification of the uncertainty of predictions, forecasts and models </li>
    </ul>  </li>
<li>The scientific discipline of statistics brings sophisticated techniques and models to bear on these issues</li>
<li>Statisticians help translate the scientific question into a statistical question, which includes carefully describing data structure; the underlying system that generated the data (the model); and what we are trying to assess (the parameter or parameters we wish to estimate) or predict</li>
    </ol>
